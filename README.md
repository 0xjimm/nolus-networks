## Build && Run node with docker

Executing the build-image.sh script will build and run a node in docker for testnet/nolus-rila network.
In the future when we have more testnets, any user could specify his desired network via --network flag passed to the build-image.sh script

1. Execute build-image.sh script to build && run a full node of testnet/nolus-rila with Docker

```./build-image.sh```
